## Key Insights

### System Architecture
DECA AI Studio is built as a **microservices platform** using:
- **11 Core Services**: API Server, Flow Manager, Node Runner, Agent Server, etc.
- **Polyglot Implementation**: Go for performance-critical services, Python for AI/ML
- **Event-Driven Communication**: NATS JetStream for reliable messaging
- **React Frontend**: Modern TypeScript-based user interface

### Technology Highlights
- **Go Services**: High-performance backend services using Gin framework
- **Python AI Services**: FastAPI-based services for AI agent management
- **MongoDB + Redis**: Primary database with distributed caching
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**: Cloud-native containerized deployment
- **Auth0**: Enterprise authentication and authorization

### Core Capabilities
- **Visual Flow Designer**: No-code/low-code AI workflow creation
- **35+ Node Types**: Extensive library of processing nodes
- **Real-time Processing**: Webhook, schedule, and event triggers
- **Multi-tenant**: Workspace isolation and security
- **AI Agent Management**: Multiple AI providers and custom agents

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services organized by business capability
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be updated independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Right tool for each service's needs

### Event-Driven
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate via events
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct knowledge of each other
- **Scalable Processing**: Events processed in parallel

### Cloud-Native
- **Containerization**: All services run in Docker containers
- **Auto-scaling**: Services scale based on demand
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with load balancing
